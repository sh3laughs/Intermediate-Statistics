# Requirements:Using the lipstick dataset you worked with in the
    # lesson, determine if the shade of lipstick and the price
    # category are related. To do this, you will need to:

# Import packages
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# %%
# Import and preview data
lipstick = pd.read_csv('/Users/hannah/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-gracesnouveaux@gmail.com/My Drive/Bethel Tech/Data Science/DSO105 Intermediate Statistics/Lesson 1. Basic Statistics in Python/lead_lipstick.csv')

lipstick.head()

# %%
        # Create a contingency table
lipstickCrosstab = pd.crosstab(lipstick.shade, lipstick.priceCatgry)

# %%
# Viewed crosstab in variable explorer:
    # shade	 1	 2	 3
    # Brown	20	30	10
    # Pink	20	49	12
    # Purple	 8	23	 6
    # Red	 5	33	 7


        # Test for the assumption of 5 per cell in the expected
            # contingency table
        # Compute an independent Chi-Square
